# Tic Tac Toe

This repo contains the beginnings (not all) of a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML5 canvas. This project is intentionally unfinished and meant to serve as a guide to help you build your own project. You can either
fork this project (using the "Fork" button in the top right of this Github repository) and complete it, or simply use it as inspiration/help for your own codebase. After the due date has passed I will publish the rest of this solution.

NOTE: This repository uses some simple math to determine if a click is inside a designated region. While you can use `addHitRegion()`, it is not supported outside of FireFox and Chrome (with the experimental flag enabled) so is not the best option for projects at this current time until support improves.
